The canonical problem -- homeostasis in ecosystems

What is ecosystem homeostasis? How is it maintained and when is it lost? These are the canonical problems in the study of ecological systems and, in many ways, more generally, all biological **systems**. These web pages are dedicated to the exploration of these issues -- and a few digressions along the way. 

Familiarity with a few related theories and perspectives are helpful in understanding ecosystem homeostasis. These ideas fall under the broad banner of "complex adaptive hierarchical systems"; however, their roots are firmly grounded in general systems theory. 

These ideas are not popular nor mainstream in current science which has decidedly taken a turn towards a narrow mechanistic focus. I preserve these thoughts here for the ecosystem and earth-system scientists of the future to mark the paths of that were taken and help them in their endeavours.
