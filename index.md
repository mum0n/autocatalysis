title: The canonical problem -- homeostasis in ecosystems
---


What is ecosystem homeostasis? How is it maintained and when is it lost? These are the canonical problems in the study of ecological systems and, in many ways, the more general study of all biological **systems**. These web pages are dedicated to the exploration of the issues related to this fundamental issue -- and a few digressions along the way. 

Familiarity with a few related theories and perspectives are helpful in understanding ecosystem homeostasis. These ideas are currently popularised under the broad banner of "complex adaptive hierarchical systems"; however, their roots are firmly grounded in general systems theory. Links to some of my (biased) perspectives on these ideas can be found in the sidebar.

I am a so-called "ecosystem" ecologist.  I have dabbled in landscape, community and population ecology of freshwater and  marine ecosystems. I am particularly interested in how thermodynamics, complexity and nonlinear dynamical systems theory can inform ecology.

Enjoy your visit,
