title: What is ecosystem homeostasis?
---

What is ecosystem homeostasis and how is it maintained and when is it lost? 

What are the mechanisms by which a steady internal state is regulated even when the external environment is highly variable? 

When do alterations to the internal structures and functions of a system result in the breakdown of this homeostatic stability. 

At the organisational scale of cell organelles, cells, endocrine systems, organs and organisms, homeostasis is a well documented phenomenon (e.g., thermoregulation, ion-regulation, hormone regulation). However, at larger organisational scales (e.g., populations, communities, landscapes, ecosystems), more than a century of effort has resulted in only controversy and confusion.
